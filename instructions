1. Create a card component.
2. Import the "db" variable from the index.js file into the content.js file.
3. Use setState() to setup an initial empty "shots" array on the content.js component.
4. Use the useEffects() hook to get the data from the db variable imported in step 2 and update the state from step 3 with the response from the get request.
5. Iterate over each item in the state with .map() and return the component created in step 1.
6. Finally, we will pass our data to the component created in step 1 via props so that it can be rendered accordingly.
